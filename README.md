# WiFi-Bike
A Project to give WiFi to rental bikes

# The Idea
We wanted to build a Mesh-Network by putting WiFi routers inside bikes and the rental stations.
Our idea was powering it with a dynamo and solar power.

# How it works
We used 1 TP Link TL-MR3020 to simulate a station and two TL-MR3020 to simulate bikes.
For the power we used 3 Solar panels with 2 Volt each. The dynamo is also serving 6V. 
With the power we are charging a battery with 10000 mah which gives the power to the router.
As Software on the Router we used Freifunk Berlin for the TL-MR3020, which makes the Router also able to mesh with other Freifunk WiFi networks.
